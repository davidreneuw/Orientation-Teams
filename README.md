# Orientation-Teams

 Automatic Creation of teams for Science Orientation 2020 onward.

 It reads an associated excel file that contains the list of all leaders and the list of all teams and then
 creates teams that are fair (Good ratio of new leaders/returning leaders). This script also takes in account
 of Coordinators, Team Captains and FuPos, putting one Coord per team, one TC per team and two FuPos per team.

 For each team it also generates an email list.
 Finally, at the end of the document, an email list is generated for TCs and FuPos.
